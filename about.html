									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>Hello, I am Ayesha Fathima, a dedicated data enthusiast with a strong passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My objective is to leverage my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to drive data-driven decisions and innovations. I hold a Bsc Degree in Statistics and Economics. My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis and economic theory, which I have applied through hands-on projects and coursework. I gained practical experience during my internship at Edu-versity, where I contributed to data science projects by utilizing tools such as Python and Excel. Additionally, I have earned certifications in Data analytics, further enhancing my expertise in data interpretation and building insights. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges and contribute to impactful data-driven solutions in the industry.

<h2>Internship</h2>
<p>During a three-month internship in the field of data science, I gained valuable hands-on experience and foundational knowledge in Python programming. This intensive course involved developing two major individual projects, where I applied my skills to real-world data challenges. Although I worked independently on these projects, I received guidance from a mentor who provided support and clarified doubts, which was instrumental given my initial lack of programming experience. This internship not only honed my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to tackle complex data problems and contribute effectively to data-driven solutions.</p>
